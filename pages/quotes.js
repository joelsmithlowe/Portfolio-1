	- The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
	- Calm seas never made a good sailor.
	- Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.
	- The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself. That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.

	- Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.
	- We are a nation of many nationalities, many races, many religions-bound together by a single unity, the unity of freedom and equality. Whoever seeks to set one nationality against another, seeks to degrade all nationalities.

	- Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
	- I have seen British imperialism at work in Burma, and I have seen something of the effects of poverty and unemployment in Britian... One has got to be actively a socialist, not merely sympathetic to socialism, or one plays into the hands of our always active enemies.

	- Quiet people have the loudest minds.
	- The thing about smart people is that they seem like crazy people to dumb people.
</p>
